# 🤖 Jarvis Voice Assistant

**Jarvis** is a privacy-focused, high-performance Edge AI assistant built for the **Raspberry Pi 4**. It bridges the gap between local "Senses" and cloud-based "Intelligence" to provide a seamless, hands-free experience for smart home control, information retrieval, and multimedia orchestration.


---

## ✨ Features

- **Local Senses:** Low-latency wake word detection via `openWakeWord` and optimized Speech-to-Text using `Faster-Whisper` (int8 quantization).
- **Hybrid Intelligence:** - **Primary:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for complex reasoning and native tool use.
  - **Fallback:** Groq (Llama-3) for near-instant responses during quota limits.
- **Smart Home Integration:** Native bridge to **Home Assistant** for controlling fans (Atomberg/PWM), lighting, and LEDs.
- **Continuous Conversation:** Multi-turn dialogue support with a 10-second active session window and question-detection to stay awake.
- **Multimedia Engine:** YouTube music streaming directly on the Pi via `yt-dlp` and `mpv`.
- **Barge-in Support:** Non-blocking speech allows you to interrupt Jarvis while he is talking.
